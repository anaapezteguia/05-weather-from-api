# Get weather from API

This project is a weather app made with React fetching data from an API.

We will see how to take the data from a form and pass them as parameters to an API, from there we will make the query to get the weather of a city.

**What I've learned:**

- Using Materialize for adding CSS styles
- Props destructuring
- Using async/await when fetching data from an API
- Extracting data from API
- Using useEffect for updating data
- Validating data
- Conditional component load

This project is part of the Udemy [React - La Guía Completa: Hooks Context Redux MERN +15 Apps](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-de-principiante-a-experto-creando-mas-de-10-aplicaciones/) course.
